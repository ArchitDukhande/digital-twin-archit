To: Archit  
Subject: Welcome to the team

Hi Archit,

Welcome to the team. We’re excited to have you join us.

You’ll be working closely with the engineering team on model inference and infrastructure-related work. The team is small and fast-moving, so feel free to ask questions and get context whenever something is unclear.

For the first week, the goal is simply to get familiar with the codebase, deployment setup, and how the current system behaves in production. No need to make changes right away.

Your manager will share next steps and priorities shortly.

Welcome aboard.

Best,  
CEO
